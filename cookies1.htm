    <p>An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data 
    that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store
    it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Typically,
    it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser â€” keeping a 
    user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the 
    stateless HTTP protocol.</p><br/>
    <b>Cookies are mainly used in:</b>
    <h6>Session Management</h6><br/>
    <p>Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.</p><br/>
    <h6>Personalization</h6><br/>
    <p>User preferences, themes, and other settings.</p><br/>
    <h6>Tracking</h6><br/>
    <p>Recording and analyzing user behavior.</h6><br/>
    <br/>
    <p>Cookies were once used for general client-side storage. While this was
       legitimate when they were the only way to store data on the client, it 
       is now recommended to use modern storage APIs. Cookies are sent with every
       request, so they can worsen performance (especially for mobile data connections).
       Modern APIs for client storage are the Web Storage API (localStorage and
       sessionStorage) and IndexedDB.</p><br/>
